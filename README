Things I would do differently or improve

1. Better research the other frameworks available and analyze advantages VS disadvantages
 in order to select appropriate framework based on knowledge
2. Deep learning of reactive spring framework to know what is the best practice 
3. Add comments, more unit testing and benchmark
